		<h3 class="h3-left"><b>Matthew Bradley:</b> “Thou wenest Ich be a beggere”: Borders and the Habitus in Late Medieval English Romance</h3>
		<p class="image-left">
This paper examines how borders in the landscapes of Middle English romance uncover the fragile
and situational nature of their heroes’ identities, and interrogates the ways in which they enforce
new rules and expectations for those who dare to cross them. Utilising Pierre Bordieu’s conception
of the habitus, the paper identifies tests of “objective homogenizing” in various romances, and how
crossings of borders necessitate or bring about changes in heroes’ disposition and status (Outline
of a Theory 80). First, attention is paid to figures such as Sir Tristrem, King Horn and Sir Orfeo who
must masquerade in “beggers cloþes” (Sir Orfeo 499) to obfuscate their identities and later prove
their courtly education. Despite how integral ‘courtliness’ is to their personae, Middle English
romances often stress the habitus’ socially-constructed nature, and how the crossing of borders
tests the efficacy of this construction. While readers are privy to a hero’s “system of dispositions”
throughout the narrative, the value of these dispositions within the text is demarcated by borders,
and heroes must quickly adapt to suit their new domains (Bordieu 82). This is exemplified in the
underappreciated Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle, where the borders of the Carle’s domain
invert the hegemony of Arthur’s kingdom, the established classes now having to “accommodate
the churls” rather than exert dominion over them (Brandsten, “Sir Gawain” 306). Through
examining the heightened chivalric identities of Middle English romance, this paper highlights the
ways in which borders permit the imposition of new rules and mores upon a space, and the
influence of these conventions in shaping conceptions of personhood, status, and power.</p>

		<h3 class="h3-left">>Funes the Arboreus: Border(less) Ecologies in Borges&#39; Ficciones</h3>
		<p class="image-left">Jorge Luis Borges’ titular mnemonist of “Funes the Memorious” once proposed “an analogous
language” to that of John Locke, which would pair “each individual thing, each stone, each bird and
each branch, [with] its own name.” The project Funes abandoned, we’re informed, because even
this “seemed too general to him, too ambiguous.” Much work on Borges concerns the vastness of
his labyrinthine fictions; however, the infinities of the second half of Ficciones are primarily fractal,
burrowing down, not out. Funes’ frustration is with his failure to wholly disentangle objects or
beings from their networks of association, or, as Eco-critic Stacy Alaimo writes, at the minute level,
“substantial interchanges render [even] the human permeable, dissolving stable outlines.” This
paper seeks to place Borges in dialogue with new, eco-critical theories of trans-corporeality;
examining how his stories reconfigure the supposedly discrete object, and trouble the ostensible
borderlines between the subject and their environment.</p>

			<p class="p-img-right">Abstract: The contribution aims to investigate the role that music played within the concentration
				camp universe, in particular through the singular story of the Auschwitz women's orchestra. The ambiguous
				position of the musicians, mostly amateurs, who found themselves performing for their own executioners, must
				be understood starting from the unprecedented potential of resistance that music, as well as art in general,
				offered to the prisoners of the camps, allowing them not only to benefit from a less brutal and mortifying
				treatment than the other prisoners, but also opening up to them precious spaces of inner freedom.</p>

		<h3 class="h3-left">Without Witness: The Aporia of Auschwitz</h3>
		<p class="image-left"> unparalleled events at Auschwitz are a metonymy for absolute evil in twentieth century history.
		Despite numerous witnesses, 	can we really say that we understand what it entailed?  For Primo Levi
		, communication is ‘necessary for a human to be human’. Historians, however, have pointed to the limitations
		of description, remarking that ‘there is no good witness, no exact description in all its parts ‘ (M. Bloch).
		Philosophy, by contrast, goes further by reflecting on a reality that exceeds the sum of facts: ‘The survivors		
		describedsomething that could not be witnessed’ (G. Agamben). Auschwitz deprives us of a possibility that seems
	   inalienable; that is to say, the capacity to exchange experiences through testimony, as it bears witness
	   to that which pertains to the Real (J. Lacan), i.e. the unspeakable, the non-symbolisable and de-subjectification.
	   So, to what extent is it possible to understand Auschwitz? Is it not the case that the events of Auschwitz are always	
	   indescribable, to a certain extent? The three impossible but indispensable professions indicated by Freud (teaching, governing,
	   psychoanalysing) can perhaps be supplemented by a fourth: description.</p>

		<p>Explo ’71: Cultural Politics and the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Irish Border

Ulster ’71 was a year of cultural celebrations held across the province to coincide with the fiftieth
anniversary of the Partition of Ireland and the creation of Stormont. It included opera tours,
anniversary stamps, theatrical and orchestral performances and a central exhibition site built in and
around Queen’s University Belfast’s new Physical Education Centre in Botanic Gardens.
Documents in the Arts Council of Northern Ireland archives in the Public Records Office of
Northern Ireland show that festival preparations began as early as 1968, just as political ‘trouble’
began in the region. Despite concerns that the programme of activities might stoke tensions (there
were 134 explosions in and around Belfast by June 1971), the organising committee pressed
ahead with their arrangements. To mitigate festival objections, planners instead opted for a PR
rebrand that presented the festival as a ‘non-political’ programme of culturally enriching events that
would be inclusive of all communities. In this paper, I’d like to suggest the festival was an attempt
by the government-funded organisers to convince the public of Northern Ireland’s validity region by
emplotting a positive historical narrative and creating a distinct ‘Ulster identity’ that did not as yet
exist. In this regard, the festival reveals much about the fragility of Unionism at that time and
highlights the complex ways in which cultural artefacts and politics intersect.</p>

		<p>Porous Borders, mise-en-scène and mise-en-abyme in Alan Moore’s Jerusalem
This paper will examine the fragility of boundaries and allusions to the framed
borders of film in the novel Jerusalem (2016) by Alan Moore, where a
multidimensional conceptualization of time and space is realized through an
engagement with mise-en-scène and mise-en-abyme. The paper will draw on
examples from early moving image, cinema and the avant-garde, from Edward
Muybridge, Charlie Chaplin, Robert Wiene, Dziga Vertov and Fernand Léger. The
analysis will draw from Laura Mulvey’s work on the porous boundaries between
stillness and the moving image: a single frame of a celluloid film strip represents a
moment in time, and a sequence of frames projected at the speed of 24 frames a
second conveys the illusion of movement, and permits the possibility of returning to
and repeating a fragment of time. For Mulvey, Chaplin embodies the cinematic
framing and mechanization of a human figure, and he appears as a character in
Jerusalem. A series of frames on a reel of celluloid film, with a beginning and end
that replay on a loop, figure in the novel for broader themes relating to the concepts of
entropy and eternalism. Characters move through the layered landscapes of the
Boroughs in Northampton, the house on the borderland, the ghost-seam, or Mansoul,
as if in a monochrome moving picture with piano accompaniment. The imagery often
has a silent-film aesthetic, with landscapes akin to compositions within a film frame,
and the narrative structure achieves the effect of a mise-en-abyme with frames
receding towards an end-point. The motif of the strip of film alludes to the
coexistence of the past, present, and future, and as the reel is cranked through the
projector towards annihilation and destruction, the text reflects on environmental
catastrophe and the demolition of working-class communities, and reconciles memory
with the lost landscapes of the past.</p>

			<h3 class="h3-right"><i>Cum-finis</i>. Our present between indeterminacy and infinity.</h3>
		
		<p class="p-img-right">The thesis I would like to assert is that the most urgent task for contemporary thought is to
			distinguish between the infinite and the indefinite. On one side, what Hegel would call the "bad
			infinite": the blind and cynical dynamization of techno-capitalism, which conceives no limit to its
			expansion, but only thresholds [Schranken] that can be infinitely shifted (both extensively and
			intensively). On the other hand, what Hegel again conceives as the true infinity: the openness that,
			in the unavoidable finiteness of every existence, forces the moment of the heterogeneous, the
			immeasurability of the relation. In this case, it is about determining a singularity through a
			boundary [Grenze] that emerges from it, but exposes it to its alterity. I would like to explore this
			theme in light of the epistemological turn that, starting from the 1970s, has conceived the entire
			world - natural and human, material and symbolic - under the sign of indeterminacy.</p>
